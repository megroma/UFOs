## Overview
This webpage has a dynamic table that can be filtered based on the user's input. The table has over 100 entries of possible UFO sightings so allowing this to be filter helps the user narrow thier interest. 

## Results
Below is what the page looks like as it first loads


These are the filters


This is how the table looks with one filter. 


This is how the table looks with Two filters.


This is how the table looks with all filters.


## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the input in the filters must be exact. If the spacing or capitalization does not match no results will return. Also the user may not know all the options so they would need to review the table prior to filtering. 
### Further Development
This draw back could be resolved by have all the available inputs be a dropdown list. This would prevent any misspellings or inaccuracies that would influence the table. 
Another way this page could be developed futher is by impleted a button to clear the filters. Currently each field needs to be manually deleted once filtered to reset.
